Eva: please create a simple GUI program for our DynaSpy Program ()
Youmin: please learn the features Windows version of DynaSpy; 
        list which features you want to include in our Linux version; 
        build a simple argument parsing program (args_parsing.py)

Khanh: I will build the logic to read the loaded dll (logic.py)

After that, we will merge our code into a complete project


For tester:
- Right now, I have two different approaches to read the DLL Map. My original solution was called
iterative approach. Basically, I will create a process of our target program. Suspend, record its DLL map,
resume, and repeat this process.  However, with program whose running time is very short (~1s), our DLL reader
sometimes might not be quick enough to catch the process and hence miss some DLLs. Therefore, we can
repeat the above process around 10 times and pick the most comprehensive results.
- However, with program whose running time is very long or even infinite, the above approach is surely time-consuming.
The iterative approach will require the program to finish running before we can output the result.
We might want to check the output as the program is running. Therefore, I still keep the single approach,
which is the same as iterative but is only repeated 1 time.

In short, there are 2 modes for this program: iterative and single.
Iterative is more accurate but more time-consuming
Single is less accutate but more responsive

To use the DynaSpy:
    if you prefer to test the version with GUI: 
        python3 DynaSpy.py -gui
    if you prefer to test with commandline only: 
        python3 DynaSpy.py -file <path-to-executable> -output <path-to-output-file> 
        -file will be compulsory. -output will be optional. 
        Notice that all the path must be absolute path, not relative path
        In addition, you might want to specify whether you want iterative or single approach by using
            -iterative or -single flag
        Here are some acceptable commands


python3 DynaSpy.py -file /home/khanhle/Downloads/DynaSpy/a
python3 DynaSpy.py -file /home/khanhle/Downloads/DynaSpy/a -output /home/khanhle/Downloads/DynaSpy/abc.txt
python3 DynaSpy.py -iterative -file /home/khanhle/Downloads/DynaSpy/a -output /home/khanhle/Downloads/DynaSpy/abc.txt
python3 DynaSpy.py -single -file /home/khanhle/Downloads/DynaSpy/a
